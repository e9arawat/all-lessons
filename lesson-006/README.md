## Learning Python

Your assignment today is to read Chapters 1 through 5 of the [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and to summarize your key learnings in proper MarkDown in the self-referencing blank files in this repo.

1. [Whetting Your Appetite](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)
2. [Using the Python Interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html)
3. [An Informal Introduction to Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html)
4. [More Control Flow Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
5. [Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

You will be judged on the quality of your understanding, the quality of your writing, and the quality of the markdown that you generate.

Understanding is important. 

Content is important. 

Presentation is important.
